Given a sorted array of distinct integers, write a function indexEqualsValue that returns the lowest index\ for which array[index] == index.
Return -1 if there is no such index.

Your algorithm should be very performant.

[input] array of integers ( with 0-based nonnegative indexing )
[output] integer

```
function indexEqualsValue(a) {
    let left = 0;
    let right = a.length - 1;
    let mid;
    while (left != right) {
        mid = Math.floor(((right - left) / 2) + left);

    if (mid <= a[mid]) {
        right = mid;
    } else {
        left = mid + 1;
